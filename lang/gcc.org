=long __builtin_expect (long exp, long c)=
The Built-in Function is used to provide the compiler with branch prediction information.
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  if (__builtin_expect(x, 0))
    foo();
#+END_SRC 
indicate that we do not expect to call =foo=.
 
Common usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC C
  #define likely(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 1) // x most likely true
  #define unlikely(x) __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0) // x most likely false
#+END_SRC
